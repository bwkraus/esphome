# esphome
A location to store my esphome yaml files


The weather-station.yaml is an ESP32 board that I am using as I assemble a weather station using the instructions found her: https://www.instructables.com/Solar-Powered-WiFi-Weather-Station-V30/

Bedroomac.yaml is an ESP8266 Wemos D1 which I have installed on my mitsubishi minisplit and integrated into hass.
